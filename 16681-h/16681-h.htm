<span class="i0">A new little baby came down from the sky&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Came down from the sky in the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soft little baby, with violet eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shining, and pure, and white.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But how did the little new baby get<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down here from the depths of the sky?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She couldn't have come alone, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For she's much too young to fly.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! the angels carried her down in their arms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the far-away, beautiful blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought her down from the arms of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A present to me and to you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, you see, we must kiss the baby,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That she may not need the angels<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till she meets them again above.<br /></span>

<h2>WHERE DID IT COME FROM?</h2>

<p>Hop, hop, hop! In it came at the window, the dearest little yellow
canary, not a bit afraid; chirping, turning its pretty head this way and
that, and asking its little bird questions which nobody could
understand.</p>

<p>George, and Winifred, and little Bruce were all filled with delight and
amazement at the small visitor. Wise George flew to shut the window,
kind Winny ran for cake, and solemn Bruce took his finger out of his
mouth and stared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dicky sidled, and fluttered, and chattered, and at last showed
he was used to society by setting down on George's finger, winking at
Bruce, and making a good meal of Winny's cake.</p>

<p>"Do you think he can have flown straight from the Canary Islands?" asked
Winny.</p>

<p>But George shook his head; it was too far.</p>

<p>But still they had a feeling that the little visitor was a sort of
emigrant, who must be led to settle at Fairleigh Cottage; and Winny ran
to ask her mother for the half-crown out of her money-box to buy him a
cage.</p>

<p>"Mother's coming," she said. "She thinks Birdie belongs to some one
else, because he is so tame."</p>

<p>"But there are no canaries in the village, except the schoolmaster's
pair," said wise George; "and this little beauty is not one of them. I
really think this bird must have come to look for a home."</p>

<h2>THE ORGAN-BOY.</h2>

<p>The children are fond of a merry tune, so they have given the organ-boy
a penny to play. The babies stare at the organ, as though they thought
it a very funny box to make such a noise. One little child, with a doll
in her arms, is giving a piece of bread to the monkey, but he looks as
if he suspected it was a trick. The boy has a cloth over his organ, to
protect it when it rains. I do not like to see monkeys led about in this
way. I think it is cruel, and must cause them much suffering, especially
if they have a cruel master. But I think this little boy will be kind to
his little companion, and not twist and throw it about as some of the
men do. Monkeys are very amusing, after they go through a short
training, and will do all manner of tricks for their master.</p>

<h2>JACK.</h2>

<p>The name of the bear is <i>Jack</i>. I fetched him from the West India Import
Dock on the 5th of November, 1870. He was running about with another
bear on board ship, but the job was to catch him. After many attempts we
at last put a strong collar round his neck, to which was attached a long
chain, and then we got him into a large barrel and fastened the head on
with hoop-iron, lowered him over the side of the vessel into a boat, and
then pulled to the quay, and hauled him up into a cart. For a time the
little fellow was quiet enough, but he got very inquisitive when being
driven towards the city, and wanted to have a look round. I managed to
quiet him by giving him pieces of lump-sugar. He arrived safely at the
Crystal Palace, and has lived in an aviary till the beginning of last
month, when he was put into his new bear-pit. The little fellow has
grown twice the size he was when he first came. He is very playful, but
sometimes he shows his teeth when he is teased.</p>

<h2>THE PLAY-GROUND.</h2>

<p>The lessons are learned, and now we all join hands, and march to the
play-ground. And a nice play-ground we have, and every day when it is
fine we enjoy ourselves very much. Some like to swing round the great
pole, others join hands and form a large ring, and then we try to see
which side of the ring can pull the hardest. Others like to run a race,
and try who will run three times round the play-ground first. When it is
wet we march round our large school-room, keeping time with our feet.
And then we have such splendid fun playing "Tag," first one, and then
the other, racing round over benches, and under and around the desks,
until we are fairly tired out. Then we hear the bell ring, and we march
in, two by two, to commence our lessons again.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF TOPSY.</h2>

<p>Topsy had four kittens, but as it was settled that we could not keep
more than one, and little Milly Knight wanting one, the other two had to
be drowned. So Milly came one day and selected a nice little black and
white one. We were very sorry when Tom took the little creatures and put
them in the pond at the bottom of the garden. As they were very young
and could not feel much, we thought Topsy would soon forget them. Well,
on the evening that they were drowned, while the cook was in her pantry,
with the window open, she saw something come rushing along, and, in
another minute, Topsy leaped through the window, carrying in her mouth
one of the kittens, dripping wet, which she laid on the mat and began to
lick with all her might. And how she licked it! Over and over, and over
again, till, as the cook said, she "licked it into life." The little
kitten got well, and became, owing to its narrow escape, and the love
displayed, a great pet ever afterward.</p>

<h2>SAGACITY OF A DOG.</h2>

<p>A very interesting story is told by Mr. Youatt: "I wanted, one day, to
go through a tall iron gate, from one part of my premises to another,
but just within it lay a poor lame puppy, and I could not get in without
perhaps seriously injuring him. I stood for a while hesitating, and at
length determined to go round through another gate, when a fine
Newfoundland dog, who had been waiting patiently for his wonted
caresses, and wondering why I did not come in, looked accidently down at
the invalid. He comprehended the whole business in a moment. He put down
his great paw, and, as quickly and as gently as possible, rolled the
invalid out of the way, and then drew himself back in order to leave
room for the opening of the gate."</p>

<h2>THE DONKEY RIDE.</h2>

<p>"Oh, papa! will you please buy me a donkey?" said little Ella Clark to
her father, as she ran to meet him. "Well," said her father, "if you
will promise to be a very good girl, and give your sister May a share of
the rides, I will get one in the city and send it home." So, in a few
days the donkey came, with a new bridle and saddle. The next thing to do
was to give him a name; so, after trying a great many they agreed to
call him "Jack." The next day Ella and May were up early and went to the
barn, where they found Henry, and asked him to saddle "Jack." Henry
brushed down "Jack's" thick coat of hair, and made him look quite trim,
and he then placed Ella on "Jack's" back, and walked him up and down,
holding on to Ella, and in a short time she could ride alone, and felt
as proud as a queen when her father saw her sitting up on "Jack's" back.
She then gave May a ride, and at last got so bold as to take "Jack" down
the lane alone, and had a splendid time riding up and down.</p>

<h2>PLAYING IN THE HAY.</h2>

<p>Little Elsie and Gertie live in the country. They do not see the gay
shops full of pretty things that amuse children in New York, and they
have never been to a bazaar, or to the Zoological Gardens, but they have
sweet flowers to smell and look at, and live creatures about them at
home. They find amusements at all seasons of the year, and are very
merry. You see them now in the field where the grass has been cut and is
drying into hay that the horses and cows will eat. The children have had
fine fun in the hay; they have spread and tossed it, and Gertie has
pretended to feed her toy goat with it, and now she wants Elsie to hide
her in it that she may jump out and surprise James their brother, who is
coming in at the gate.</p>

<h2>"I'M GRANDMOTHER."</h2>

<p>Mary is a good little girl, but is meddlesome. She has a good
Grandmother, called Mrs. Mason, and she sometimes goes to her house. One
day Mary got into mischief. Seeing her Grandmother's spectacles on the
table, she put them on her nose, and said, "I'm Grandmother." Mary began
to march about the room in a very grand way. Presently the spectacles
fell off, and the glasses were broken. Poor Mary cried bitterly, and at
first did not know what to do; but when Mrs. Mason came in, she told her
all, and promised never to play "Grandmother" again. Mrs. Mason told her
not to cry, and she might play "Grandmother" as much as she liked, but
she was to be very careful not to take her spectacles, and she would get
her papa to get a pair of tin ones, with holes in them, so that she
could see as well, and look all the funnier.</p>

<h2>UPSETTING BABY'S MILK.</h2>

<p>"Ponto," the dog, who was longing for a run with nurse and baby, came up
into the nursery to see if they were nearly ready for their walk. Nurse
had gone out of the room, leaving baby fastened into her chair with a
saucer of milk on the ledge in front of her. Ponto would not have taken
the milk without leave&mdash;he knew better how to behave than that; but he
wanted baby to give him some, and did not know how easily the saucer
would be upset: one great paw put on the little shelf sent it over,
broke it, and spilt the milk. You see the baby is not at all afraid of
the dog, and she is too good-tempered to cry about the milk being spilt;
but she holds her spoon out of Ponto's way and says, "Naughty, naughty!"</p>

<h2>CLEVER TRAY.</h2>

<p>I want to tell you a true story about the terrier dog you see having a
game at hide-and-seek with our two children.</p>

<p>One evening, nurse had put baby to bed, and tucked her in quite snug and
warm. Having to do some shopping, nurse went out, and, in going along
the street she felt something pulling her skirt, and on looking down
discovered Tray with her skirt in his mouth. Nurse thought he was only
playing, and tried to shake him off, but he began to bark and whine, and
seemed to say, in his doggish way: "Please <i>do</i> attend to me; <i>do</i> come
back with me!" that at last, just to see if he would leave off, she
began to walk home. And oh, how delighted Tray was! When they reached
the house Tray ran up-stairs, and nurse discovered baby sitting up in
bed, and screaming sadly. The little thing had awoke, and finding
herself alone, began to cry; and the faithful dog had heard her, and set
off directly to find nurse.</p>

<h2>MY FRIEND WASHINGTON.</h2>

<p>When I was a very little girl, one of my best friends was Washington
Henry. He was one of our servants, who made himself useful inside of the
house, and was as black as night, as you may see by the picture. He
liked nothing better than to meet me outside the house and have a romp,
and he would take me all round the barn and show me the ducks, and hens,
and the nice little chickens, and wheel me round in the baby-carriage,
while he capered and danced about like a high-mettled steed. I can tell
you we had plenty of fun, and father often used to wonder how it was I
liked Washington so much, but it was only because he was more kind and
considerate than any of the other servants. His old mother lived in a
little cottage with his younger brother and sister, and he used to take
me round there sometimes, and they had always something new to show me.</p>

<h2>A LARK IN A CRICKET-GROUND.</h2>

<p>A few days ago I was passing through Sonning, an old English village on
the Thames, when I was attracted to a field near the road by hearing the
merry sounds of the village school at a game of cricket. I could not
resist the pleasure of pausing to watch the boys at play. Before long my
curiosity was aroused by shouts of "Look out!" "Take care!" "Mind where
you're going!" whenever any boy approached a certain spot, which seemed
to be within a few yards of one of the wickets. I asked one of the party
what such outcries meant. He replied&mdash;"Oh, that's our lark, sir!" On
inquiry I found that some weeks before, the boys discovered a titlark's
nest in the ground close to their cricket-piece. One of the boys seems
to have made the suggestion that the school should take the lark under
their special patronage. The proposal was adopted, and it became a daily
business to see, before settling to their play, that all was right with
the lark.</p>

<h2>A FOUR-FOOTED THIEF.</h2>


<p>The Paris <i>Figaro</i> says:&mdash;"On Friday a new kind of robber was arrested
not far from a hatter's, and holding a hat between his teeth. When
efforts were made to take the hat away he stood on the defensive, and
there was a fight, which ended very badly for the hat. The thief was a
dog. His master, who has not yet been found, had taught him to bring
home goods to him for sale, and the hatter accuses him of having carried
off no less than six hats within a week."</p>

<h2>THE PERFORMING MONKEYS.</h2>

<p>Amusing creatures! I can look at the picture with pleasure, because they
are evidently well treated, and have not the miserably cowed expression
we see upon many of the monkeys that go about our streets. Sometimes
when I have given a monkey a piece of cake or fruit, I have made a
bargain with the master to let him sit still and eat it, and much amused
I have been watching the little animal's extreme enjoyment of the treat
and the holiday. The monkeys at the Zoological Gardens have tolerably
large cages. I wish the parrots were as well off: they sadly need more
space, and would be glad of bits of stick to play with.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
